TerpTrak â€“ Smith School Success Metrics

**Business Outcome**: The project aimed to create a comprehensive database to support prospective students in making informed decisions by providing transparent program rankings and related academic data for the University of Maryland's Smith School. This effort was designed to enhance academic excellence and improve the quality of educational services.

**Solution**: Our team developed a robust database system that integrated data from various sources, including program details, faculty qualifications, alumni employment records, and employer information. The solution included designing a conceptual schema and implementing relational tables that ensured data consistency and integrity. Advanced SQL queries were used to extract key insights, such as program performance metrics, alumni employment outcomes, and salary analysis.

**Result**: The project resulted in a user-friendly and structured database that allowed for efficient data retrieval and analysis. This enhanced the school's ability to track program performance, facilitate data-driven decision-making, and provide prospective students with valuable insights into program rankings, faculty achievements, and alumni success. Ultimately, the database supported strategic resource allocation and improved transparency in academic administration.
